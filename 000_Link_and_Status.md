#### DESCRIPTION

This is a web page form to calculate a tip given the following parameters:

- a) Amount of the bill
- b) Service rating
- c) Number of diners sharing the bill

The service rating is applied to tip calculation as follows:

- a) excellent = 25%
- b) good = 20%
- c) okay = 15%
- d) mediocre = 10%
- e) terrible = 5%

When the calculate button is clicked, calculate the value and display it on the form.

#### STATUS

Completed on 2020-11-19.

Improvement Opportunities:

- The form should validate the bill amount and diner count inputs to ensure that they are valid numerica inputs
- The "calculate" button should be disabled until valid entries are present in bill amount and diner count input fields
- _HOWEVER, these improvements are beyond the scope of this project and will not be implemented as part of this assignment_
